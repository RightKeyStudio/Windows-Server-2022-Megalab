# üß† Windows Server 2022 Megalab Project

Simulated a full enterprise environment with Active Directory, user/group provisioning, NTFS permissions, Group Policy, and PowerShell-based log analysis tools. This project showcases practical cybersecurity and systems administration skills.

## ‚úÖ Key Skills Demonstrated

-   **Active Directory Management:** User and group provisioning, Organizational Unit (OU) design.
-   **NTFS Permission Control:** Implementing granular folder access permissions.
-   **Group Policy Objects (GPO):** Configuring and enforcing security policies (e.g., UI lockdowns, drive mapping).
-   **PowerShell Scripting:** Advanced log parsing, data extraction, and CSV export.
-   **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) Lite:** Real-time login failure monitoring (Event ID 4625) and threat IP extraction using PowerShell.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Phase 1: Active Directory Design & Management

Designed and implemented a logical Active Directory structure for `ajx.local`, including custom Organizational Units (OUs) for department-specific user and group management. User accounts were provisioned across these OUs, and security groups were created (e.g., `AJX_Staff`, `Finance_Staff`) to facilitate streamlined access control and policy application.

*Demonstrates a user account's membership in relevant security groups, crucial for permissions and GPO targeting.*

## üìÇ Phase 2: File System Security & Group Policy Enforcement

Configured robust file system security using NTFS permissions and enforced security best practices across the domain through Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

### NTFS Permissions

Granular NTFS permissions were applied to shared network drives, ensuring that only authorized security groups (e.g., `AJX_Staff`) had appropriate access levels (e.g., Modify) to sensitive data.

### Group Policy Object (GPO) Lockdowns

Implemented restrictive GPOs to enhance endpoint security for standard users, preventing access to critical system tools.

*Displays the configured GPO settings in the Group Policy Management Editor, including policies to disable Control Panel, Command Prompt, and Task Manager.*

*Validation of GPO enforcement: A standard user's attempt to access Task Manager is successfully blocked by the applied Group Policy.*

### GPO Drive Mapping

Automated network drive mapping for users based on their Active Directory group membership, providing consistent access to shared resources.

## üîê Phase 3: PowerShell Log Analysis & SIEM Simulation

Developed PowerShell scripts to perform real-time security monitoring, focusing on failed login attempts (Event ID 4625), and to extract and export critical security event data.

### Real-time Login Monitoring Dashboard

A continuous PowerShell script simulates a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboard, providing a live, console-based view of failed login attempts, including timestamps, usernames, and source IP addresses.

### Log Parsing and Data Export

Utilized `Get-WinEvent` with advanced filtering and regex to efficiently parse Windows Security event logs for Event ID 4625 (failed logons). Extracted key details were then structured and exported to CSV files for audit, further analysis, and long-term storage.

![Raw Get-WinEvent Output](ScreenshotsScreenshots/powershell_getwinevent_parsing.png)
*Demonstrates the raw output from a targeted `Get-WinEvent` query, highlighting the ability to filter and retrieve specific security events.*

![Exported Failed Logins CSV](ScreenshotsScreenshots/failed_logins_csv_content_parsed.png)
*Content of an exported CSV file, showing structured failed login data (TimeCreated, IPAddress), ready for auditing.*

All generated log data (CSV files) is stored in a dedicated, shared directory on the domain controller, accessible for centralized security analysis.

##üîê Failed Logins Automation Extension

To extend the original Megalab project, a fully automated failed login monitoring system was implemented using PowerShell and Task Scheduler. This extension ensures that failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625) are continuously tracked, exported, and available for auditing without manual intervention.


![PowerShell Script](ScreenshotsScreenshots/FailedLoginscsv.png)
The script collects recent failed login events from the Security log, extracts the timestamp, username, and source process, and exports the data to a centralized CSV file. This allows for easy review and historical analysis.

![Script Location](ScreenshotsScreenshots/FailedLoginsps1location.png)


The script resides in C:\Scripts\, keeping it organized alongside log data.

![Script Contents](Winvent5.png)


The script uses Get-WinEvent with a filter for Event ID 4625, loops through each event to create a custom object, and exports the collection to FailedLogins.csv.

![Task Scheduler Automation](ScreenshotsScreenshots/tskschedulerproperties.png)
Task Scheduler was configured to run the script every 15 minutes. This automates the process, ensuring the CSV file is always up-to-date without manual execution.

![Task Scheduler Status](ScreenshotsScreenshots/taskscheduler.png)


The screenshot confirms that the scheduled task runs successfully and updates the log file on schedule.

![CSV Output](ScreenshotsScreenshots/FailedLoginscsv.png)
The resulting CSV file provides a structured record of failed login attempts, including the exact time, username, and source process.

Sample CSV Output:


The CSV captures multiple failed attempts, enabling quick auditing and analysis.

![Simulated Failed Login](ScreenshotsScreenshots/PwshAdminWrongpassowrd.png)
To test the automation, a fake failed login was generated using PowerShell, simulating an incorrect administrator password. This ensures the script detects and logs events as expected.

![Fake Login Demonstration](ScreenshotsScreenshots/Factsrun.png)


The screenshot shows the simulated failed login, which appears in the CSV after the scheduled task runs.

This extension solidifies the project‚Äôs SIEM-lite functionality, making the monitoring of failed logins fully automated, auditable, and verifiable.

## üß© What‚Äôs Next

-   **Azure Cloud VM Deployment:** Extend the environment to Azure for hybrid cloud management and integration.
-   **Email Alerting:** Configure PowerShell scripts to send email notifications for critical security events, such as brute-force attempts.
-   **GPO-Based Account Lockouts:** Implement advanced GPO settings to automatically lock out user accounts after a defined number of failed login attempts, enhancing brute-force protection.
